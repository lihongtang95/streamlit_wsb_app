# streamlit_wsb_app

A Streamlit/Heroku web application that pulls comments from the most recent Daily Discussion forums of the WallStreetBets subreddit and provides a visual summary of the most-mentioned stock tickers. The link is below.

NOTE: The heroku app can take a couple minutes to load. The number of comments per pushshift request is limited, and larger discussion threads can have upwards of 20,000 comments. Working on improving this.
